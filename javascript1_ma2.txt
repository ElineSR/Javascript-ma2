//MODULE ASSIGNMENT 2 - LEVEL 1

1. What is a function literal?
	
	Function Literal uses the reserved word function. It is optional if you want to give it 
	a name, but this name can be used to call the function repeatedly and is good for 
	identifying it during debugging. If there is no name it is anonymous. The parameters 
	are wrapped in parentheses and can hold none or several parameter names separated by commas.
	These become variables within the function and initialized to the arguments supplied. 
	The statements wrapped in curly braces are the body of the function and are executed when invoked.



2. What is the constructor?

	Every function expression is a constructor. constructor is a terminology from 
	object oriented programming. It is also a method that returns the function 
	that created this object's instance. 
	







3. What does the return statement do?

	The return statement is used when you want return a value from a function. 
	Everything inside a function will stop after it has reached the return 
	statement. The code after return will not be executed and be declared 
	unreachable.  







4. What will be written to the console from this function:
		function myFunction(){
			  return console.log('inside my function');
			  console.log('My name is Andy');
		}
		myFunction();
		
		This console logs: inside my function 








5. Briefly describe scope in JavaScript.

	There are two types: global and lokal scope.The global scope 
	is outside the functions and can be used by all. Lokal scope 
	is inside functions and can only be accessed there. Lokal 
	scope can access global scope, but global scope can not 
	access lokal scope.
